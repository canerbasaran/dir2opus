dir2opus: version 0.12

Manifest:
 README     - You're reading it now.
 COPYING    - The License under which dir2opus is released.
 NEWS       - Changes between the versions
 install.sh - A bash script to automate installation.
 dir2opus    - The script itself.
 dir2opus.1  - The manpage for dir2opus

Installation:
 (Not so) new in dir2opus is the install.sh script, which automates installation of
 the script. You should only use this if you have root access to the computer
 you are attempting to install dir2opus on. If you do not have root access then
 you will have to use dir2opus from your home directory (perhaps you have a
 /home/username/bin directory?).

 To install simply run:
  sh install.sh

Requirements:
 - Tag preservation: mutagen (http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet/wiki/Development/Mutagen)
 - M4A Conversion: faad or mplayer (ALAC: alac-decoder)
 - WMA Conversion: mplayer
 - MP3 Conversion: mpg123, mpg321, lame or mplayer
 - FLAC Conversion: flac or ogg123
 - Ogg Vorbis Conversion: oggdec or ogg123
 - CD Ripping: cdparanoia, icedax or mplayer

Usage:
 Read the manpage for detailed instructions: "man dir2opus", or type "dir2opus
 --help" for brief usage details. The script is extremely simple, so you
 shouldn't have any troubles figuring it out.

 Dir2opus can take multiple filenames as arguments, and will Do The Right Thing
 based on the file extension. If using the '-d' flag, you may only give directories
 as arguments, not filenames and directories

 If you wish to convert m4a, wma and/or wav files using -d then the -m, -f and -w
 flags must be used respectively (FLAC: --convert-flac). Wav files are deleted
 by default, use -p to keep wav files after conversion.

 There is also support for CD ripping using the '-c' flag. This functionality
 is not well supported, and it may be better to use a different program for
 such a task.

Bugs:
 See the manpage. Please report bugs at https://github.com/3M3RY/dir2opus
