.TH DIR2OPUS 1 "2013-11-04" "dir2opus 0.12.0"
.SH NAME
dir2opus \- Convert MP3, WAV, and M4A files to Opus format
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdir2opus\fP [ options ] ( \fIfilename\fP [\fIfilename2\fP] ... || \fIdirectory\fP [\fIdirectory2\fP] ... || [\fIcdrom-device\fP] ... )
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdir2opus\fP converts MP3, M4A, WMA and WAV files to the open\-source Opus format. \fIdir2opus\fP is a python script that simply binds together mpg123, faad, and opusenc making it easier for the user to convert his/her music files. Opus files are about 15 to 20 percent smaller than MP3 files, with the same relative audio quality. \fIdir2opus\fP can be called with the \fI\-d\fP flag at the command line to convert any number of directories at once, or given MP3, M4A, WMA,
and/or WAV filenames as arguments, \fIdir2opus\fP will convert only those files. If converting WAV, M4A or WMA files with \fI\-d\fP you must add
the \fI\-w\fP, \fI\-m\fP or \fI\-W\fP command line flags respectively. These flags are not neccesary unless using \fI\-d\fP.
Note that converting M4A files requires you to have faad installed, and converting WMA files requires mplayer.

Keep in mind that converting from MP3 or M4A to Opus is a conversion between two lossy formats. This is fine if you just want to free up some disk space, but if you're a hard\-core audiophile you may be disappointed. I really can't notice a difference in quality with 'naked' ears myself.

.SS General Options
.TP
\fB\-h or \-\-help\fP
print quick usage details to the screen.
.TP
\fB\-d or \-\-directory\fP
convert all MP3 files in \fIdirectory\fP. WAV and M4A files will be converted
if used with the \fI\-w\fP and \fI\-m\fP command line flags. This option is for
compatibility purposes only and does not need to be specified anymore.
.TP
\fB\-r or \-\-recursive\fP
like \fI\-d\fP but descends recursively into directories.
.TP
\fB\-c or \-\-cdda\fP
Convert an audio CD into opus. You may pass the device as an argument to the script (default: /dev/cdrom). Requires cdparanoia orq icedax or mplayer
.TP
\fB\-p or \-\-preserve-wav\fP
preserve all WAV files. By default they are deleted.
.TP
\fB\-P or \-\-no\-pipe\fP
Do not use pipes to send data from the decoder to the encoder, use temporary
wav files instead.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete-input\fP
Delete the input file after conversion
.TP
\fB\-v or \-\-verbose\fP
increase \fIdir2opus\fP's verbosity.
.TP
\fB\-Q or \-\-quiet\fP
Do not display progress messages, except the name of the file which is
currently converted. Some decoders provide no way to disable messages and thus
may still display some.

.SS Conversion options
.TP
\fB\-\-convert-all\fP
Convert all supported audio files found in the directories given on the
command-line to Opus.
.TP
\fB\-f or \-\-convert-ape\fP
Convert all APE (Monkey's Audio) files found in the directories given on
the command-line to Opus, using either ogg123 or flac or mplayer.
.TP
\fB\-f or \-\-convert-flac\fP
Convert all FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files found in the directories
given on the command-line to Opus, using ogg123 or flac or mplayer.
.TP
\fB\-m or \-\-convert-m4a\fP
convert all M4A (MPEG-4 Audio) files found in the directories given on the
command-line to Opus, using faad or mplayer. For decoding ALAC
(Apple Lossless) files, 'alac-decoder' may be used.
.TP
\fB\-m or \-\-convert-mpc\fP
convert all MPC (MusePack) files found in the directories given on the
command-line to Opus, using mpcdec or mplayer.
.TP
\fB\-g or \-\-convert-ogg\fP
convert all Ogg Vorbis files found in the directories given on the
command-line to Opus, using oggdec or ogg123.
.TP
\fB\-W or \-\-convert-wma\fP
Convert all WMA (Windows Media Audio) files found in the directories given
on the command-line to Opus, using mplayer.
.TP
\fB\-w or \-\-convert-wav\fP
Convert all WAV files found in the directories given on the command-line
to Ogg Vorbis.
.TP
\fB\-V or \-\-convert-wv\fP
Convert all WV (WavPack) files found in the directories given on the
command-line to Opus.
.TP
\fB\-n or \-\-no-mp3\fP
ingore all MP3 files found in directories given on the command-line.
.TP
\fB\-\-(ape|cd|flac|m4a|mp3|mpc|wma|wv)\-decoder=COMMAND\fP
Set the decoder you want to use for one filetype, e.g.: \-\-mp3-decoder=lame.
Run dir2opus \-\-help to see the available decoders.
.TP
\fB\-qN or \-\-quality=N\fP
Encoding computational complexity (0-10, default: 5). Zero gives the fastest encodes but lower quality, while 10 gives the highest quality but slower encoding.'
